# cclib

**IMPORTANT for upcoming 2.0 release** We are preparing for the 2.0 release now that 1.8.1 is done.
Although most of the new features are on the unstable `main` branch, we will now be making some breaking changes to the default `master` branch.
See https://github.com/cclib/cclib/issues/1395 for more information.

- If you choose to follow `main`, we reserve the right to rewrite history until the final `v2.0` tag is created, after which `main` will replace `master` as the default branch.
- We do not expect to make any further tagged or versioned releases on the `master` branch.
- This message will disappear when the final release of 2.0, after any alphas/release candidates/etc. is made.
